    <h2>School of Electronic Engineering (SENSE)</h2>

    <p class="school-description">
        The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering was established in 2017 and became the School of Electronics Engineering (SENSE) in January 2019. At present, the School is headed by Dr. Umakanta Nanda. The School has qualified and committed faculty members who offer impressive instruction in a variety of modes, exploring experiential learning approaches and new pedagogical methods in order to provide proper learning to students.
        <br><br>
        The School provides the necessary infrastructure, hardware, and software to support the faculty for their continuous learning and research. The programmes offered under SENSE are meticulously designed for a strong real-world application and industrial relevance. They range from the application of science in transforming semi-conductor materials as usable devices, which may be used to create “smart” innovative products, to enabling students design efficient, affordable mechanisms for communicating information.
        <br><br>
        At present, the following programmes are offered at the undergraduate and post-graduate level:

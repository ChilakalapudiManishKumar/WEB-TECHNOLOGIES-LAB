        <h2>About School</h2>
        <p>
            The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 2017 
            and became the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCOPE) in 
            January 2019. At present, the School is headed by Dr. CH. Pradeep Reddy. 
            The School has qualified and committed faculty members who offer impressive 
            instruction in a variety of modes, exploring experiential learning approaches 
            and new pedagogical methods in order to provide proper learning to students. 
            The school provides the necessary infrastructure, hardware, and software to 
            support the faculty for their continuous learning and research.
